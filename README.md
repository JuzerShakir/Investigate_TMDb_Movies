### Introduction

In this project, we have a given database of 10k+ movies which contains data such as `title, cast, director, runtime, budget, revenue, release year` etc. I have conducted my own data analysis and brainstormed what questions can be answered with the data given. I have used `Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn` libraries to answer the questions. Finally after looking all the answer i have given my conclusions.
