### Introduction

In this project, we have a given database of 10k+ movies which contains data such as `title, cast, director, runtime, budget, revenue, release year` etc. I have conducted my own data analysis and brainstormed what questions can be answered with the data given. I have used `Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn` libraries to answer the questions. Finally after looking all the answer i have given my conclusions.

### Data for investigation

The `tmdb_movie_data.csv` file contains the data the have to be worked on. The investigation of this data has been done in `Investigating_Database.ipynb` jupyter file.

### Why this project?

This project goes through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. Have used Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, Saeborn which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

### What did I learn?

After completing the project, I have:
 - Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process.
 - Comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions.
 - Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format that can be used.
 - Have practice communicating the results of the analysis.
 - Being able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and Pandas to speed up your data analysis code.
 - Being familiar with Pandas Series and DataFrame objects, which lets access data more conveniently.
 - Lastly but not least, Know how to use Matplotlib and Seaborn to produce plots showing findings.
